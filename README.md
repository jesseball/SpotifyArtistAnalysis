# SpotifyArtistAnalysis

Welcome to the SpotifyArtistAnalysis wiki!

This project was created by Jesse Ball and Seth McMillan. This project will attempt to use statistical analysis and machine learning to predict the artist of a song by using certain track features. These track audio features are pulled from Spotify's API. This project will collect and parse the data using a python script into a clean format. This data will then be imported to R. The data will then undergo some exploratory analysis. After this preliminary analysis a classifier will be attempted to be built based on the features pulled in. The classifier will try to guess an artist based off a tracks audio features.
